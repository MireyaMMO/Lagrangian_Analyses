In Chapter 2, 3 and 4 of this thesis lagrangian analyses were performed. All the lagrangian particle releases were done using OpenDrift.

The analyses done for chapter 3 "A climatological baseline of the simulated Eulerian and Lagrangian coastal Bay of Plenty" can be found here [github.com/MireyaMMO/cLCS](https://github.com/MireyaMMO/cLCS)

Analyses and calculations covered in this repository regarding chapter 2 and chapter 4 include:
- Absolute and relative dispersion
- Spaghetti Plots
- PDF (Probability Density Functions)
- Connectivity Matrices
- Dispersal Kernels
